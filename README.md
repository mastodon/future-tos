# Revised Terms of Service for mastodon.social and mastodon.online

Mastodon gGmbH operates two Mastodon servers, mastodon.social and mastodon.online, under the jurisdiction of German law.

In June, we proposed to implement new Terms of Service that would apply to registered users of these servers, with the possibility of these terms being used as a template for other, future, default installations of the Mastodon software.

Our community made it clear that we had not done enough to consider the implications, and that we had not met their expectations. We heard you. We’re sorry that this happened, and for not taking the time to consider that proposal more carefully.

We’ve been working with decoded.legal (Neil Brown), and with our law firm in Germany, on new Terms of Service for registered users of mastodon.social and mastodon.online. We aim for our terms to be straightforward, and written in user-centric language. As an organisation, Mastodon aims to be user-first. We’d now like to share the progress of this effort with the community.

## What has changed?

In this draft, we have:

* started from scratch, to prepare a simplified, shortened, and (hopefully) more readily comprehensible, set of terms. We have done the drafting in English and, as a German company, we will also provide a German version of these terms, once they are finalised.  
* restricted the scope to registered users of mastodon.social/mastodon.online, to address concerns relating to interactions with .social and .online from the broader fediverse.  
* addressed specific feedback regarding the previous licensing language, in particular in respect of termination.

## Community consultation

We are sharing these proposed Terms of Service with the community today, for comment and feedback, in case there’s something that we might have missed, or that there may be concerns or questions about.

* This is not a request for *consensus*, it is a request for comments. It is important to note that these Terms of Service are closely aligned to the specifics of German law, and to our liabilities as the operating organization for these two Mastodon servers. As above, these terms will only apply to registered users of these servers; they are not an attempt to impose any terms on the broader fediverse.  
* Let us know if anything is not clear, so that we can consider re-wording it.  
* Also let us know if you have questions, so that we can provide answers.  
  * Clarifications may be provided in Q\&A format elsewhere, if they do not belong inside the Terms of Service directly.

* You may use this GitHub Discussions thread to discuss the terms.  
* Alternatively, please email your comments to [hello@joinmastodon.org](mailto:hello@joinmastodon.org)with a subject line of “Terms of Service consultation feedback”.   
  * If you contact us via email, we will acknowledge receipt of your message.  
* We promise to review all the feedback that we receive via this GitHub Discussion thread or via email. We cannot promise that we will act on all the feedback that we receive, because, as the entity responsible for these two servers, we need to be comfortable with our terms, and the resultant risk. Due to the legal complexity of these matters and the lack of internal legal staff, we may not be able to respond in detail.  
* Note that we may not see your specific comments via other channels, including responses within the fediverse, as our team’s ability to monitor a wide range of forums is limited.

## Timeline

* The consultation period runs from today, October 6th 2025\.  
* We will close the consultation on October 19th, 2025 to review the comments, make adjustments where appropriate, and prepare Q\&A as needed. Comments received after this date will not be considered for inclusion in modifications made at this time.  
* \[subject to complexity of any modifications\] We will then publish the finalised version of the Terms of Service, to go into effect on mastodon.social and mastodon.online. The new ToS would be in effect starting November 3rd 2025\.  
  * If you have an account on mastodon.social or mastodon.online and have concerns about the new Terms of Service, you may [move your account to an alternative Mastodon server](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#migration).

## Looking ahead

The original proposal included a plan to use the Terms of Service as a boilerplate option for future installations of the Mastodon software. Right now, we are focussing on the terms for our own two servers, and the specific requirements that we have.

We still intend to provide a basic template for operators of Mastodon servers. This may be based on a similar format and language to those used in the new ToS for our own servers, but will omit the alignments with German law (although instances based in Germany may want to adopt these) and will require server operators to actively make their own choices about terms and conditions for their own jurisdictions. This is not an attempt to impose a standardised set of terms on the fediverse, or to give legal advice to administrators of other instances, but rather to be helpful, and offer a sensible, pragmatic starting point. There is no current timeline for introducing these changes to the code Mastodon code base.

## Gratitude

We are very grateful for your support and understanding. We want to thank mcc, Sarah Jamie Lewis, Cory Doctorow, and Neil Brown, for offering clear and direct feedback on our original proposal. We would also like to thank the Electronic Frontier Foundation; our partners in Germany; and decoded.legal; for their help with this work.
