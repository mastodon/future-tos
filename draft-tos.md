# Terms for registered users of mastodon.social

## Definitions

These words and phrases have the following meanings in these terms:

"Service": the online service available at mastodon.social.

"We" (and "us", and "our"): Mastodon gGmbH.

"You" (and "your"): the person who accepted these terms (or a previous or updated version of them).

"Content": anything which someone (you, or anyone else) uploads to the Service, or which is visible to you because of your use of the Service. This includes text (including profile information), audio, images, videos, and polls, or a combination of these.

## These terms apply to registered users

These terms apply to the provision of the Service by us to registered users of the Service.

They apply when you register an account to use the Service, and continue until you, or we, delete your account.

You can end this agreement at any time by deleting your account. You do not need to notify us.

These terms do not apply to anyone who is not a registered user of the Service. This includes people using other federated services, who interact with Content on the Service or whose Content is visible to users of the Service.

The only language applicable for the conclusion of this agreement is German. Translations of these terms into other languages are provided for information purposes only. These terms are stored and can be accessed at [link].

## This is a free service with limited liability

You can use the Service without paying us anything. This is a free service.

This means that:

* While we try to maintain and operate the Service, we make no promises that it will always be available for you to use or functioning (correctly or at all), nor that it will be fault-free.
* We may suspend, limit, or cease to operate any or all of the Service, or vary its functionality, if and to the extent reasonably necessary for operational, security, legal, or business reasons. Where possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice. Your statutory rights remain unaffected.
* We are fully liable for damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health; for intent; for gross negligence; and under the Product Liability Act. Apart from these cases, we are only liable for negligence if material obligations under this agreement are breached. Material obligations are those that are essential for fulfilling this agreement, whose breach would jeopardize its purpose, and on which you may rely. In such cases, liability is limited to typical and foreseeable damages. The same applies to liability of our vicarious agents for breaches of contractual obligations. In all other cases, we are not liable for negligence.

## Things you must do, and consequences if you do not

You must do all of the following:

* Comply with the Server Rules, available at https://mastodon.social/about, as updated from time to time
* Comply with all laws, in whatever jurisdictions, which apply to you and your use of the Service.
* Not do anything which puts us in breach of any laws, in whatever jurisdictions, which apply to the Service.
* Only upload Content in respect of which you have the rights to grant us the licence set out below.
* Behave at all times in a polite and professional manner towards us and our moderators, administrators, technical staff, support staff, and everyone else involved in any aspect of the Service, and respond promptly to any communications from them.

If you do not do these things, or if we are required by law to do so, we may do some or all of the following:

* Send you a warning or reminder.
* Require you to take remedial action promptly in respect of some or all of your Content.
* Delete, or change the visibility of, some or all of your Content.
* Suspend or limit your access to the Service.
* Terminate your account (where we have a right to terminate for cause).
* Share your Content and information that we hold about you with courts and law enforcement agencies, but only if we reasonably believe that it is necessary for us to do so to safeguard ourselves, the Service, other users of the Service, or you, or if we are required by law to do so.

We will do this by human review.

To the greatest extent permitted by law, all of our decisions are final.

## How we host, share, and remove your Content

### Ownership is unchanged

Nothing in these terms gives us ownership of your Content. Whoever owns the Content retains ownership.

### Your licence to us

When you upload Content to the Service, you automatically grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence solely to operate and maintain the Service (the "Licence"). The Licence includes:

* Hosting your Content.
* Automatically transforming and modifying your Content, and how we display your Content, by way of:
  * Translating and localising your Content using automated translation tools.
  * Sanitising and formatting your Content to make it available in different formats (e.g. JSON, XML) and via different interfaces (e.g. via the web, via one or more APIs for application access, via RSS).
  * Shortening the length of, or partially hiding, displayed Content.
* Making your Content available to, and transmitting your Content to, other users and other servers (which, in each case, might store your Content on their own, or third party's computers), and any processing, transformations and modifications necessary to do this.
  * When you upload Content to the Service, you are making it available via the Internet. Anyone, or any computer, might access your Content via RSS aggregators and readers, embed your Content in web pages and other media, or index and store your Content in search engines and databases. Please note that neither we, nor you, have control over these uses of your Content, and these services may not display your Content as you expect it.
* Moderating Content.
* Backing up your Content, and restoring your Content from backups (including Content which you have deleted, as described below), to enable us to restore the Service in the event of a problem.

### Automatic licence termination on deletion

If you delete your Content, your Licence to us, in respect of us continuing to host, make available, and transmit that Content, ends automatically.

In respect of your Licence to us to create and restore backups, Content that you have deleted from the live Service may remain in our backups. If it does, your Licence to us in respect of that Content does not terminate automatically. If we restore the Service from a backup containing that Content, we will once again be hosting, making available, and transmitting that Content. To try to lessen the likelihood of this situation arising, we aim to restore from the most recent working backup, and we will try to inform you (including by way of a general announcement by means of the Service, rather than a specific communication to you) if we restore from a backup, so that you can check if that has restored any Content which you had deleted.

Be mindful that, because this is a federated service, Content that you upload to the Service may - and probably will - be transferred to other people's servers. Deleting Content from the Service does not guarantee that it will be deleted from other servers or people's computers, as this is outside our (and your) control.

## Dispute resolution

"Claim" means any claims, disputes, losses, or other matters arising from, out of, or in connection with, these terms or the Service.

These terms, and any Claims, whether contractual or non-contractual, are governed by the laws of Germany (excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)). The competent courts of Germany shall have jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these terms. 

You may contact us anytime at legal@joinmastodon.org with information about your Claim to enable us to try to resolve it with you.

## Data processing

“Data Protection Legislation” means all applicable data protection and privacy legislation in force from time to time including national laws implementing the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (2002/58/EC), Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the "GDPR") and any similar national privacy laws.

If, under Data Protection Legislation, you are the controller of the processing of personal data and we are carrying out one or more processing activities on your behalf as your processor, our [data processing terms for mastodon.social] apply in respect of those processing activities.

The [data processing terms for mastodon.social](./draft-data-processing-terms.md) do not apply when we are a controller in respect of a processing activity. In respect of those processing activities, please see [our privacy policy](https://mastodon.social/privacy-policy).

(Note: for the vast majority of our users and processing activities, we will be a controller, not a processor, and our data processing terms will not apply. We have produced these data processing terms for the unlikely but possible situation in which we are someone's processor.)

## General terms

We may need to update these terms from time to time, so that they accurately reflect the Service and practices, promote a safe experience of the Service, and/or ensure compliance with applicable law. We will only make changes if the terms are no longer appropriate or are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable for you taking your interests into account, or if they are necessary for security reasons or to comply with applicable law. We will notify you at least 30 days in advance before making changes to these terms, unless such changes are required by law. You will then have the opportunity to review them before they take effect. Our notice will explain this 30-day period and what it means. Once the updated terms take effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use the Service. We hope that you will continue to use the Service, but if you do not agree to our updated terms or wish to end this agreement, you may close your account at any time.

If any part of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by any court, this will not affect the other provisions of these terms and those provisions will remain in full force and effect.

If we fail to exercise a right or remedy, this failure will not prevent us from exercising that right or remedy later for that or any other incident.

We may use sub-contractors to perform our obligations under these terms. We remain fully responsible for the performance of all such obligations.

Nothing in these terms establishes any partnership, joint venture, or agency between you and us.

No-one other than you or us has any rights under these terms, and no-one other than you or us has any right to enforce these terms.
