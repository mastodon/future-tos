# Sample data processing terms

## Note: this is different to our privacy policy!

The GDPR requires everyone who processes personal data for their own purposes to be transparent about the processing of personal data for which they are responsible. (In legal terms, where the organisation is the “controller” in respect of the processing activities.) We do this via our privacy policy.

The GDPR also requires people to have certain things in their contracts when they process personal data on behalf of someone else. (In legal terms, where that person is a “processor”, carrying out processing activities following the instructions of a controller.) This is what this document covers.

For the vast majority of our users and processing activities, we will be a controller, not a processor. Our privacy policy, not these data processing terms, applies to that processing. We have produced these data processing terms for the unlikely but possible situation in which we are someone's processor – for example, some processing activities for a corporate or governmental user of the Service.)

## Definitions

These words and phrases have the following meanings in these data processing terms:

"UK GDPR": The GDPR, as defined in section 3(10) (as supplemented by section 205(4)) of the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act 2018.

"Applicable Law": either (a) if the GDPR applies to the Processing, any law of the European Union or the law of one of the Member States of the European Union, or (b) if the UK GDPR applies to the Processing, any law in the United Kingdom.

"Sub-processors": other processors which we, acting as a processor, appoint to process personal data.

Terms which are defined in the GDPR, and which are not defined in the [terms for registered users of mastodon.social] or in these data processing terms, have the meaning defined by the GDPR.

## When these data processing terms apply

These data processing terms supplement, and are subject to, the [terms for registered users of mastodon.social].

If, under Data Protection Legislation, you are the controller of the processing of personal data and we carry out one or more processing activities on your behalf as your processor, these data processing terms apply in respect of those processing activities.

These data processing terms do not apply when we are a controller in respect of a processing activity. In respect of those processing activities, please see our privacy policy.

## Things you must do

You must do all of the following:

* Ensure that any instructions that you give to us with respect to the processing of personal data are lawful and will not cause us, or you, to breach any law.

* Give us your general authorisation to appoint Sub-processors. This means permitting us to appoint Sub-processors without getting your prior approval. It is not viable for us to provide the Service and act as your processor without your general authorisation to appoint Sub-processors so, if you wish to withdraw your general authorisation, you can, but you must delete all personal data from the Service, so that we cease to be your processor.

* If you ask us to do one or more things which these data processing terms say that we will only do if you pay our charges, you must pay our charges for doing those things, since these are not part of the free Service. We may ask you to pay our charges in advance. If we do not receive payment in full, you agree that we are not obliged to do the things that you request.

## Things we will do

If, in the course of providing the Service, you are a controller and we are your processor in respect of any processing of personal data, we will, in connection with that processing, do all of the following:

* Process the personal data in accordance with Applicable Law.

* Process the personal data only to provide the Service. This is your documented instruction to us.

* If we are required to act other than in accordance with your instructions by Applicable Law, we will inform you before processing the personal data, unless we are prohibited from informing you.

* Sub-processors

  * We have your general authorisation to appoint Sub-processors.
  * If we appoint Sub-processors, we will respect the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 28 GDPR.
  * Subject to the limitation of our liability in the [terms for registered users of mastodon.social], we will be liable for the acts and omissions of our Sub-processors.
  * We will ensure that the Sub-processor contract (as it relates to the processing of personal data) is on terms which are substantially the same as, and in any case no less onerous than, these data processing terms.

* Ensure that anyone authorised by us to Process the personal data has committed themselves to confidentiality.

* Take all security measures required of us by Article 32 GDPR.

* Taking into account the nature of the processing, assist you, subject to you paying our charges, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, to fulfil your obligation to respond to requests for exercising any Data Subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR.

* Provide, subject to you paying our charges, reasonable assistance following your written request to us, in ensuring your compliance with your obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 GDPR, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to us.

* At your choice and subject to you paying our charges, delete or return all the personal data for which we are your processor to you after the end of the provision of the Service, and delete existing copies. We are not required to delete personal data if we are required to continue store those personal data by any law in the United Kingdom.

  * Be mindful that, because this is a federated service, Content, including personal data, that you upload to the Service may - and probably will - be transferred to other people's servers. Deleting Content from the Service does not guarantee that it will be deleted from other servers or people's computers, as this is outside our (and your) control.

* subject to you paying our charges and following written agreement as to the details, make available to you all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 28 GDPR, and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by you or another auditor mandated by you.

* notify you without undue delay if, in connection with our processing of personal data as your processor, we become aware of a personal data breach for which we are responsible.

## Scope of processing

* Subject matter, nature, and purpose of our processing: to provide the Service.

* Duration of processing: until you delete the personal data from the Service, or the personal data is otherwise deleted from the Service.

* Type of personal data and categories of data subjects: these are determined by you through your use of the Service, and may include people with whom you interact using the Service (including other users of the Service and users of other services with which the Service federates), and people whose personal data are included in any Content.
